### What is WordPress?
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com) is a program that allows it's users to create complex websites with the click of a button.  It's also very user friendly especially to people with very little website experience, a person with no knowledge in web development can create a basic website in just a few hours.

### CMS
It’s what’s known as a CMS (Content Management system). It’s a program created to manage the content on your website with just a few clicks, the content being your post, pictures, and videos.  It provides you, the user, with tools to better manage the content your visitors see.

### What is WordPress best known for?
What WordPress is best known for is its template engine.  Its template engine works by taking the repetitive sections of your website—thing like your logo,navigation bar, and your footer, and creating templates of them to use as reference for future post. WordPress does all of this under the hood without you having to worry about it, to its users it's just a page on its interface where you can click on and start creating or editing post right away.  Its user friendly features makes it one of the reasons that [34.7%](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all) of all websites on the internet are powered by it.

I personally enjoy using WordPress because its easy use, although this website is using Jekyll, I’d suggest using WordPress to someone starting off.  WordPress also has a lot of themes and plugins from third parties that will help you look good and get found on Google a lot faster, a good portion of them being absolutely free.  The majority of all web host providers have an option to install WordPress on their servers, if you need any help I’d be happy to lend a hand.

If you're interested in WordPress, stick around, I'll be posting more about it very soon.
