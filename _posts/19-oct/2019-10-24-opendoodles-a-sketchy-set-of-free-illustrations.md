### What is Open Doodles?

[Open Doodles](https://www.opendoodles.com) is a set of visually captivating open source illustrations contributed by [Pablo Stanley](https://twitter.com/pablostanley), a designer who currently works at InVision.  These amazing illustrations come with a CC0 license, which means you can use these for whatever you want for free, including commercial purposes. 

### How open source design help others

The [source](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/egmjlot3o8787sr/AABbIT7a1-3zWvF7HQ8R21_ta?dl=0) files are provided in SVG format, this was done by Pablo with the purpose of providing a creative point of reference for other designers.  Giving out the source files gives designers the ability to freely dissect an illustrations design structure.  This learning technique helps designers learn new methods by building on top of the work of others, which is how he learned and the reason why these beautiful illustrations are FREE.  

### How Pablo want to help the design community 

One of his other intentions is for designers to use theses as placeholders when presenting their designs.  He hopes they help designers show their clients that there is a lot of value in illustrative story telling.  And most importantly he hopes it inspires other designers to create illustrations that they can share. 

### More About Pablo & Open Doodles

I enjoyed reading about how his passion for design landed him in jail when he was younger, and how it lead him to become a better designer and leader. It's a really inspiring story that you should take a look in the [about](https://www.opendoodles.com/about) section of the  Open Doodles website. 

You can also find a list of other open source illustration sets, which Pablo has provided in the same section.
