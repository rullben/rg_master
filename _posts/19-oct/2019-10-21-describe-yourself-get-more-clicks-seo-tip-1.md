I use Google as the main search engine reference in this post because of it's popularity, but this information is relevant  other search engines like Bing,and Yahoo.  

### What is a meta description, and where does it go in an HTML file?

Here is what the meta description tag looks like in HTML

`<meta name="description" content="describe what this page is about"/>`

The meta description tag goes in the head of an HTML file,HTML files are what websites are made out of.  

### What does a meta description do for a web page?
![meta-descripions-highlighted-seo-tip-1](/assets\images\19-oct\meta-descriptions-highlighted-seo-tip-1.jpg)

The meta description is supposed to summarize what’s specific about a web page.  The meta description tag is important because it’s the text that Google inserts underneath the clickable titles in the search results, it can get someone to click on your page if it contains relevant information to them. 

### What happens when I don't fill out my meta descriptions?
When you don’t fill in your meta description Google’s software fills it in for you, and usually it's a jumble of keywords. You might have the best content for someone who’s looking for an answer to their solution, but without a meta description they’ll scroll right past you in the search results.  I think it’s better to have descriptions that are well thought out and written by you than to have a robot try and figure out what each of your pages is about.

### Can filling out your meta descriptions increase your web traffic?
Google uses your CTR (Click through rate) as a ranking factor for your website.  [CTR](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2615875?hl=en) is a score assigned to your website that is a good indication of how useful your page is to your user. CTR is determined by using different variables like, time spent on a page, times your link was clicked in the results, and impressions.  The better your CTR is the higher Google will rank it in it's future results.  By having a meta description that accurately describes your pages you increase the chances of attracting more visitors.

### Some Quick Tip for Writing Meta Descriptions

Writing a meta description doesn’t have to be hard, just make sure to keep these tips in mind.

- **Active & Inviting**

  Remember to write your meta descriptions in an active and inviting voice. You want to make people scrolling their search results feel welcome and with some urgency to learn about what they're looking for from you. 

- **Call-To-Action**

  Your descriptions should also contain a call-to-action, this means emphasizing how your page will help them and what they should do; *"Click Here To Learn More"*, *"Learn More About Our Services"*, *"Sign Up For These Tips"*. Your meta description is essentially a sales pitch. 

- **People Not Robots**

  Make sure your meta descriptions are written for people and not for computers, by that I mean you should focus on properly communicating your message to your potential visitors, rather than inserting as much keywords to help your pages rank higher. This use to work but Google’s caught on and doesn't work anymore, in some cases you even get penalized for it. 

- **Ideal Meta Description Length**

  Google is always changing how much of the meta description they show, it’s been different throughout the years, but as of now in 2019, it’s about [160 Characters](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description)  .
