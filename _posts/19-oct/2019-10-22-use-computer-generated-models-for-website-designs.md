### AI Generated People
The people over at [Generated.Photos](https://generated.photos) have given us this really cool library containing 100,000 models’ profile shots.  

The interesting thing about these images is that not all of them contain real people; the majority of these models were generated by computers using artificial intelligence.  

Another fascinating thing about this is the diversity in the models, the actual models they use and the ones that are generated range in age, ethnicity, and gender.  Having so many options gives you the ability to create visuals for more than just one industry.   

### How Photos.Generated can help web designers looking for pictures of models?
One of the small yet annoying obstacles I face as a web designer is finding stock images of people.  I occasionally need them when I'm doing a final design for a client or making a website template.  Photos.Generated helps me with that by providing a huge list of models to choose from.

Finding images of models that compliment each other is a little hard to do. Usually when you try to get images of models on the fly what ends up happening is the backgrounds are different, the clothes the models wear contrast, or the pictures have different lighting effects.  I’m not saying it’s impossible to get a group of images that look similar, or that you can’t cut and blend something in Photoshop, what I am saying is, why waist all that time when you can just use Photos.Generated.

### How I've Used Photos.Generated
I’ve used these images to improve my design skills.  I create mockup websites for Adobe Xd and upload them to Behance and dribbble for people to download and to show my work. I've noticed other designers use them for a point reference for another design or to learn about website structure.

I used them in this last project I did in the “meet the team” section, it did pretty well on both sites and it's been [downloaded](https://www.behance.net/gallery/85887073/Free-Adobe-Xd-Apartment-Finding-Web-App-Service-Landing) a couple hundred times. I think that the quality of this template was better than some of my past work.

### Something to Note
One of the things I found with this library, which your able to see right away, is that some of the models faces look off.  What stood out to me the most was that some of the models eyes don’t look quite right, this type of issue comes with working with AI, but besides that you still have a large portion of them to choose from.
